				<h1>A Monthly Newsletter</h1>
				<p> Advent was came from a latin word "Adventus",
				   which means arrival or coming. It is a season 
				   when we prepare for the coming of our Lord. It 
				   is the first season of the Liturgical calendar.
				   The advent celebration is both a commemoration 
				   of Christ's first coming and an anticipation of
				   his second coming.</p>

				<p>The Advent season lasts for four sundays. 
				The four sundays of advent are the season of 
				hope, peace, love and joy. These four sundays
				were represented by candles placed in an advent
				wreath. December 2, 2018 was the first sunday 
				of advent which is the season of hope. We celebrate
				the hope we have in Jesus Christ. December 9, 2018
				was the second sunday of advent which is the season 
				of peace. We celebrate the peace we find in Jesus Christ.
				December 16, 2018 will be the third sunday of 
				advent which is the season of love. We celebrate
				the love we have in Jesu Christ. And December
				23, 2018 will be the last sunday of advent which 
				commemorate the season of joy. We celebrate the joy
				we find in Jesus Christ. The last sunday 
				is the preparation for the celebration of the 
				birth of Jesus Christ.

				<p> In preparation for the birth of Jesus Christ,
					different traditions are present. During the 
					month of December, San fernando City, La Union 
					always have different events that are inline 
					to the Advent season. Last December 1, 2018, 
					the lighting of lights and giant christmas tree
					at the city town plaza were launched to the citizens
					of San Fernando City. But no matter traditions people 
					have, at the end of the day we are all gathered to witness
					and welcoming the coming of our dear Lord, Jesus Christ.</p>
